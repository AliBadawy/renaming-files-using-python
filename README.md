# renaming-files-using-python
This script can help you rename multiple files and order the in a specific path on your device .

#How is it set up?
All you need is python 3 ,maybe python 2 would work with a little of syntax modification 

#How is it used? 
you need to provide the program _during runing _ with the path of the directory, and the name desired for all files 

#EXAMPLE:
if the directory contain many folders with random name like : text_05541613.txt , text_0554161323edwwef3.txt ,text_05541dsdd1323edwwef3.txt

you should enter the path as:"C:\Users\----\------\New folder"
and the name of the files as : TEXT_FILES

the output would be :1_TEXT_FILES.txt, 2_TEXT_FILES.txt, 3_TEXT_FILES.txt
